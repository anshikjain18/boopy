Welcome to BooPy's documentation!
===================================

**BooPy**  
BooPy is an educational Python package meant to be used to create term structures for fixed income products. It is written in pure Python with considerably inspiration from the c++ package QuantLib. This is done to allow newcomers of the fixed income world to easier digest the underlying code of QuantLib without needed to learn c++.

As of now only linear interpolation is available and the following instruments are implemented
- Deposits
- Forward Rate Agreements
- Swaps
and it is an ongoing work to implement more!

Check out the :doc:`example` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`quickstart` the project.
