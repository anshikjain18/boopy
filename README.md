# BooPy
BooPy is an educational Python package meant to be used to create term structures for fixed income products. It is written in pure Python with considerably inspiration from the c++ package QuantLib. This is done to allow newcomers of the fixed income world to easier digest the underlying code of QuantLib without needed to learn c++.

As of now only linear interpolation is available and the following instruments are implemented
- Deposits
- Forward Rate Agreements
- Swaps
and it is an ongoing work to implement more!

# Getting Started
See [Getting started](https://boopy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for installation instructions.
